# Current Sprint

## Active Sprint

Sprint: 12 - Register Core

## Sprint Goal

Turn the authenticated register shell into the first complete sale flow: show sellable catalog items, build a cart, record supported beta payment methods, create the order safely, and hand off a receipt-ready result.

## Immediate Focus

- Real product grid in `/register`
- Cart quantity editing and totals
- Cash payment and manual transfer/card recording
- Order creation through the existing backend invariants
- Register loading, empty, error, and permission states
- UI validation against the beta north star flow

- RBAC permissions for catalog create/update/delete
- `CatalogView` at `/catalog`
- Category create/edit/deactivate UI
- Product create/edit/deactivate UI

**Validation evidence:**
- Production Vercel deployment validated on commit `a2275a7e7e32d6dd0dcbcab3f38721ac2a86e813`
- Authenticated production UI validation completed for `/catalog`
- Category create, product create, product update, product deactivate, and category deactivate all succeeded from UI

- `RegisterView` shell at `/register` with catalog + cart placeholders
- `permissions.ts` migrated from URL-param hack to role-based RBAC via AuthContext
- All protected views (`Inventory`, `Shifts`, `Reports`, `OrderDetail`, `Billing`) migrated to `usePermission` hook
- Billing moved to `/settings/billing`
- `GET /api/v1/orders` paginated endpoint with tenant scoping
- `OrderListView` with loading/empty/error states
- `seed_demo.py` - idempotent demo bakery tenant with 5 categories and 10 products
- Fly.io auto-deploy CI step on push to main
- All unit, integration, and e2e tests updated for the new auth layer

**Validated:**
